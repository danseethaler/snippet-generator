# snippet-generator package

Insanely fast way to turn your code into a snippet.

This packages adds two features to Atom:

- Instantly convert the selected code into a snippet valid format that can be pasted into your snippets.cson file.
- A snippet for creating a snippet. Isn't that fancy? Seriously though, in your snippets.cson file you'll be able to type `snip` to quickly add the title, prefix, and body to your snippet.
